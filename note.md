  #### Phase 1 Goal:
  - [MainFeature] : Running the pipeline tasks within execution to the host target
  - [MainFeature] : On manage pipeline can get repo from Github or famous repositories info
  - [MainFeature] : On pipeline running, with info from manage pipeline, download git zip and deploy by commit sha on execution, and send it to the host target
  - [MainFeature] : On pipeline running, can download which file on target host to the pipeline running folder.
  - [MainFeature] : Enable webhook
  #### Phase 2 Goal:
  - [MainFeature] : On pipeline running, can override variable environment value by api request with schema from variable.

# RoadMap:
## Phase 1 
- [Webhook] : Create Webhook Module:
  ### Description:
  The user can add webhook with many push data service

    - Create manage webhook item [Alpha]
    - Create tester and per webhook item  [Alpha]
    \
    &nbsp;
- [Pipeline] : Create full script programing or something with add environment [Alpha]
- [Pipeline] : Create tester for pipeline item for better experience [Alpha] 
- [Queue] : Create link {{link}} variable {{job_id}} variable generated by queue for pass to mustache [Alpha]
- [PipelineTask] : Create component can jump other queue with call queue record  [Alpha]
- [Queue] : Create link for call as api service [Alpha]
- [QueueScheduler] : Create add new queue as next periode "For One time scheduler only" [Pending]
- [User] : Create personal access token [Alpha]
- [DeleteData] : Create scenario delete data with all relation impact from project, pipeline, pipeline_item, variable, execution, queue_record, queue_record_detail [Alpha]
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Display queue process with id job [Alpha]

## Revision phase 1
- change order numbering pipeline task [Done]
- when try to going execution test the exist execution not display new pipeline item [Done]
- when display page process get sort by execution pipline ordering number [Done]
- when try add more new pipeline and save the current setting [Done]
- Improvement host page after add new [Done]
- Listen back state [Done]

## Phase 2
- [Pipeline] : Can attach git repo just only git url and fill which branch
- [Credentials] : Change table oauth_users to be credentials, and can manage
  - Secret text - a token such as an API token (e.g. a GitHub personal access token),
  - Username and password - which could be handled as separate components or as a colon separated string in the format username:password (read more about this in Handling credentials),
  - Secret file - which is essentially secret content in a file,
  - SSH Username with private key - an SSH public/private key pair,
  - Certificate - a PKCS#12 certificate file and optional password, or
  - Docker Host Certificate Authentication credentials.
- [Auth] : If open some url, and not login yet, will redirect to login. So save the url open before on query url, and after login success back to current url again was try opened [Waiting] 
- [Host] : Change all auth information is get from table Credentials with filter [Waiting]
- [AdminMenu] : Enable interactive menu on side menu admin [Alpha]
- [Queue] : Add delay and add fix time delay for create new queue from queue [Waiting]
- [QueueSchedule] : Change workflow queue schedule no need from execution again create as group [Waiting]
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Improvement message notif success and error pipeline [Waiting] 
- [User] : Manage join group share project [Waiting]
- [Webhook] :Create manage webhook history [Waiting]
- [Webhook] : Create template every webhook [Waiting]
- [Pipeline] : Write file use echo with array method without sftp - if possible [Waiting]
- [UserExperience] : Improvement all experience like validation, user navigation [Waiting]
- [PipelineItem] : can clone pipeline item [Waiting]
- [PipelineItem] : can download pipeline item [Waiting]
- [UserExperience] : Improvement all experience like validation, user navigation [OnProgress] 
- [Pipeline] : Create new lib form codemirror for easy compile and usable for other case [Pending]
