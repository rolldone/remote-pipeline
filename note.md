### execution:
  - Delete execution will delete storage/executions/[execution_id]

    - Yes => will delete the all relation with this pipeline
    - No => just keep like that
### pipeline_item:
  - Delete pipeline will display dialog warning if have relation with pipeline_item, execution, and etc, and have two option:
    - Yes => will delete the all relation with this pipeline
    - No => just keep like that

# RoadMap:
## Phase 1 
- [Webhook] : Create Webhook Module:
  ### Description:
  The user can add webhook with many push data service
  Task :
    - Create manage page to create webhook first include Script list, New Script, Update webhook [Alpha]
    - Create manage webhook item [Alpha]
    - Create tester and per webhook item  [Alpha]
    \
    &nbsp;
- [Pipeline] : Create full script programing or something with add environment [Alpha]
- [Pipeline] : Create tester for pipeline item for better experience [Alpha] 
- [Queue] : Create link {{link}} variable {{job_id}} variable generated by queue for pass to mustache [Alpha]
- [UserExperience] : Improvement all experience like validation, user navigation [OnProgress] 
- [PipelineTask] : Create component can jump other queue with call queue record  [Alpha]
- [Queue] : Create link for call as api service [Alpha]
- [QueueScheduler] : Create add new queue as next periode "For One time scheduler only" [Pending]
- [User] : Create personal access token [Alpha]
- [DeleteData] : Create scenario delete data with all relation impact from project, pipeline, pipeline_item, variable, execution, queue_record, queue_record_detail [OnProgress]

## Phase 2
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Display queue process for guest with id job as token with expired [Waiting]
- [User] : Manage join group share project [Waiting]
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Improvement message notif success and error pipeline [Waiting] 
- [Pipeline] : Create new lib form codemirror for easy compile and usable for other case [Waiting]
- [Webhook] :Create manage webhook history [Waiting]
- [Webhook] : Create template every webhook [Waiting]
- [AdminMenu] : Enable interactive menu on side menu admin [Waiting]
- [Pipeline] : Write file use echo with array method without sftp - if possible [Waiting]
