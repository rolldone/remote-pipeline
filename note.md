  - Also can download zip and deploy by commit sha on execution
  - Notification script
  #### Phase 2
  - Dynamic environment value by api request
  - Connection hopping and Create tunnel for instant connection 
  - Ansible integration

## Scenario crud:
### execution:
  - Delete execution will delete storage/executions/[execution_id]
  - Delete queue relation with this execution
### pipeline:
  - Delete pipeline will display dialog warning if have relation with pipeline_item, execution, and etc, and have two option:
    - Yes => will delete the all relation with this pipeline
    - No => just keep like that
### pipeline_item:
  - Delete pipeline will display dialog warning if have relation with pipeline_item, execution, and etc, and have two option:
    - Yes => will delete the all relation with this pipeline
    - No => just keep like that
### pipeline_task:
  - Delete pipeline will display dialog warning if have relation with pipeline_item, execution, and etc, and have two option:
    - Yes => will delete only have contain pipeline_task on execution

# RoadMap:
## Phase 1 
- [Webhook] : Create Webhook Module:
  ### Description:
  The user can add webhook with many push data service
  Task :
    - Create manage page to create webhook first include Script list, New Script, Update webhook [Alpha]
    - Create manage webhook item [Alpha]
    - Create tester and per webhook item  [Alpha]
    \
    &nbsp;
- [Pipeline] : Create full script programing or something with add environment [Alpha]
- [Pipeline] : Create tester for pipeline item for better experience [Alpha] 
- [Queue] : Create link {{link}} variable {{job_id}} variable generated by queue for pass to mustache [Alpha]
- [PipelineTask] : Create component can jump other queue with call queue record  [Alpha]
- [Queue] : Create link for call as api service [Alpha]
- [QueueScheduler] : Create add new queue as next periode "For One time scheduler only" [Pending]
- [User] : Create personal access token [Alpha]
- [DeleteData] : Create scenario delete data with all relation impact from project, pipeline, pipeline_item, variable, execution, queue_record, queue_record_detail [Alpha]
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Display queue process with id job [Alpha]

## Revision phase 1
- change order numbering pipeline task [Done]
- when try to going execution test the exist execution not display new pipeline item [Done]
- when display page process get sort by execution pipline ordering number [Done]
- when try add more new pipeline and save the current setting [Done]
- Improvement host page after add new [Done]
- Listen back state [Done]

## Phase 2
- [Pipeline] : Can attach git repo just only git url and fill which branch
- [Credentials] : Change table oauth_users to be credentials, and can manage
  - Secret text - a token such as an API token (e.g. a GitHub personal access token),
  - Username and password - which could be handled as separate components or as a colon separated string in the format username:password (read more about this in Handling credentials),
  - Secret file - which is essentially secret content in a file,
  - SSH Username with private key - an SSH public/private key pair,
  - Certificate - a PKCS#12 certificate file and optional password, or
  - Docker Host Certificate Authentication credentials.
- [Host] : Change all auth information is get from table Credentials with filter [Waiting]
- [AdminMenu] : Enable interactive menu on side menu admin [Alpha]
- [Queue] : Add delay and add fix time delay for create new queue from queue [Waiting]
- [QueueSchedule] : Change workflow queue schedule no need from execution again create as group [Waiting]
- [QueueRecordDetail] : Improvement message notif success and error pipeline [Waiting] 
- [User] : Manage join group share project [Waiting]
- [Webhook] :Create manage webhook history [Waiting]
- [Webhook] : Create template every webhook [Waiting]
- [Pipeline] : Write file use echo with array method without sftp - if possible [Waiting]
- [UserExperience] : Improvement all experience like validation, user navigation [Waiting]
- [PipelineItem] : can clone pipeline item [Waiting]
- [PipelineItem] : can download pipeline item [Waiting]
- [UserExperience] : Improvement all experience like validation, user navigation [OnProgress] 
- [Pipeline] : Create new lib form codemirror for easy compile and usable for other case [Pending]
